# first-web-page
This is my first web page developed using HTML and CSS. 
So, basically I have started learning HTMl and CSS. I'm in class 7nth right now, and currently my age is 12. I am being mentored by my teacher Aashish Gupta (asysgupta@gmail.com). 
Let's see how high I fly..
May the force be upon me....
